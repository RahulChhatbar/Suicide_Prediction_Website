# Suicide Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting suicidal tendencies using various machine learning models and a custom deep learning model. It leverages advanced classification techniques to analyze text data and identify patterns associated with suicidal intent.

## Features
- Implementation of multiple machine learning classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighborsClassifier)
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Development of a custom deep learning model combining BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network).
- Creation of an ensemble model using a weighted average for probability aggregation.
- Evaluation metrics for performance comparison.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle Suicide Watch Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch). It consists of labeled text data indicating suicidal intent. Preprocessing steps include text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
